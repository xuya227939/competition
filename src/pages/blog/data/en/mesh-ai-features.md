## Intelligent Text-to-3D Conversion

This is Meshivo 3D's most core feature, capable of converting natural language descriptions into precise 3D models:

### Natural Language Processing

Meshivo 3D uses advanced NLP technology to understand complex descriptive language, including:

- Shape and geometric feature descriptions
- Material and texture requirements
- Color and lighting effects
- Style and artistic direction

### Context Understanding

The AI system can understand contextual relationships in descriptions, ensuring generated models align with users' true intentions.

## Intelligent Material Matching System

Meshivo 3D's material system can automatically select the most suitable materials for 3D models:

### Material Library

Built-in over 1000 high-quality materials, including:

- Metal materials (stainless steel, copper, iron, etc.)
- Stone materials (marble, granite, limestone, etc.)
- Wood materials (oak, pine, walnut, etc.)
- Fabric materials (silk, cotton, leather, etc.)
- Special materials (glass, ceramic, plastic, etc.)

### Intelligent Matching Algorithm

Machine learning-based algorithms can analyze model features and automatically recommend the most suitable material combinations.
