## Prompt Optimization Techniques

### 1. Structured Descriptions

Effective prompts should include the following structure:

- **Main Object**: Clearly describe the primary object to be created
- **Material Properties**: Specify material type, color, texture
- **Geometric Features**: Describe shape, dimensions, proportions
- **Style Direction**: Explain artistic style, era characteristics

**Example:**

### 2. Keyword Usage

Use professional terminology and descriptive vocabulary:

- **Shape Words**: cylindrical, spherical, cubic, conical
- **Material Words**: metal, wood, stone, glass, ceramic
- **Style Words**: modern, classical, industrial, minimalist, vintage

### 3. Avoid Vague Descriptions

- ❌ Poor description: "a nice looking thing"
- ✅ Good description: "a modern-style transparent glass ornament, 15cm tall, with subtle frosted surface effect"

## Model Export Best Practices

### 1. Choose Appropriate Formats

Select export format based on intended use:

- **OBJ Format**: Compatible with most 3D software, good compatibility
- **FBX Format**: Supports animation and material information
- **GLB Format**: Suitable for web display and mobile applications
- **STL Format**: Ideal for 3D printing

### 2. Optimize Model Quality

- **Polygon Count**: Adjust detail level based on purpose
- **Material Resolution**: Balance quality and file size
- **Texture Compression**: Use appropriate compression ratios

### 3. File Naming Conventions

Establish unified naming rules:

## Workflow Integration

### 1. Integration with Design Software

**Blender Integration:**

- Import models generated by Meshivo 3D
- Perform detail adjustments and material optimization
- Add lighting and rendering effects

**Maya Integration:**

- Use Meshivo 3D as a concept design tool
- Perform detailed modeling in Maya
- Combine usage to improve efficiency

### 2. Team Collaboration Workflow

**Design Phase:**

1. Use Meshivo 3D to quickly generate concept models
2. Team review and feedback
3. Iterative design optimization

**Development Phase:**
